When running the test of asgn1 VS asgn2 when GETin a large(400MiB) using time, erroneously I believe, I notice a slight speedup.

The speedup is observed as under user 0.088s to 0.008s(multithreaded), the other values appeared more or less the same.

Within my system I believe the bottleneck is the way main handles dispatching. The queue is fairly redundant thanks to the way accept and sockets work.

At a time there can be as many concurrent worker threads and loggers(handled by the same threads) working together as there is allowed(default 4).
There is only one dispatcher however. Perhaps I could find a way to have multiple dispatchers available to send socket_fd's off to threads. 

I believe the dispatcher is the bottleneck here.

We would not log the entire contents of the file in real life because files could be enormous and we would not need to see/have all of that data.
