Run with ./httpserver [optional flags in any order]* PORT [optional flags in any order]*

As of this version of the repo, the only thing left unimplemented is the hex conversion of the file contents logging.

The program properly logs, minus any hex conversion, and truncates the log_file when the server starts(Though the test fails sadly).
